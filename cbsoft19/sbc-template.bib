@article{Bruch2009,
abstract = {The suggestions made by current IDE's code completion features are based exclusively on static type system of the programming language. As a result, often proposals are made which are irrele- vant for a particular working context. Also, these suggestions are ordered alphabetically rather than by their relevance in a particu- lar context. In this paper, we present intelligent code completion systems that learn from existing code repositories. We have imple- mented three such systems, each using the information contained in repositories in a different way. We perform a large-scale quantita- tive evaluation of these systems, integrate the best performing one into Eclipse, and evaluate the latter also by a user study. Our ex- periments give evidence that intelligent code completion systems which learn from examples significantly outperform mainstream code completion systems in terms of the relevance of their sugges- tions and thus have the potential to enhance developers' productiv- ity.},
